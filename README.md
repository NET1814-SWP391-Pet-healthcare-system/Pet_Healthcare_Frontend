# 🐾 Pawfect Care - A Pet Care Website

Welcome to Pawfect Care, your one-stop solution for all your pet care needs! Built with love and care using React, TypeScript, Vite, NextUI, and Shadcn, this project aims to provide a seamless and enjoyable experience for pet owners.

## 🚀 Supercharged with Vite

Our project is supercharged with Vite, which provides a lightning-fast development experience. We use two official plugins for Fast Refresh:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/)

Vite's out-of-the-box features like Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and optimized build help us to develop and deploy faster.

## 🛠️ ESLint Configuration

We've set up some basic ESLint rules for development. For a production-ready application, we recommend expanding the ESLint configuration to enable type-aware lint rules. 

Here's how you can do it:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` with `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install `eslint-plugin-react` and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list

These configurations help us maintain a clean and consistent codebase.

## 🎨 NextUI and 🗂️ Shadcn

NextUI provides a rich set of UI components that we use to build a visually appealing pet care website. Shadcn is our choice for state management, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
